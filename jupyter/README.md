# Jupyter Workflow at OLCF

> **Video recording:** <https://vimeo.com/730396217>

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks offer a unique environment for users to analyze and process scientific data.
The interactive nature of the web interface allows one to debug, visualize, and share code instantly, without having to handle everything on the command-line.
Because Jupyter notebooks can contain both computer code and rich text elements (paragraphs, equations, figures, widgets, links), this allows you to create human-readable documents containing analytics, results, and descriptions.

[OLCF offers a JupyterHub](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/services_and_applications/jupyter/overview.html), which allows users to run CPU and GPU JupyterLab sessions with access to the Summit and Andes filesystems.
The OLCF Jupyter environments also offer standard analysis and Machine Learning libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy) pre-installed.

The demo provides an overview of how to access Jupyter at OLCF and how to utilize the interface in an analytics setting.
This includes hands-on examples of how to analyze data generated on OLCF systems, along with a Deep Learning workflow demo run with Jupyter.
